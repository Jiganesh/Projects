			Norman Ernest Borlaug was an American agronomist who led initiatives worldwide that
			contributed to the extensive increases in agricultural production termed
			the Green Revolution. Borlaug was awarded multiple honors for his work,
			including the Nobel Peace Prize, the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the
			Congressional Gold Medal. Borlaug received his B.S. in forestry in 1937
			and Ph.D. in plant pathology and genetics from the University of Minnesota
			in 1942. He took up an agricultural research position with CIMMYT in
			Mexico, where he developed semi-dwarf, high-yield, disease-resistant wheat
			varieties. During the mid-20th century, Borlaug led the introduction
			of these high-yielding varieties combined with modern agricultural
			production techniques to Mexico, Pakistan, and India. As a result, Mexico
			became a net exporter of wheat by 1963. Between 1965 and 1970, wheat
			yields nearly doubled in Pakistan and India, greatly improving the food
			security in those nations. Borlaug was often called "the father of the
			Green Revolution", and is credited with saving over a billion people
			worldwide from starvation. According to Jan Douglas,
			executive assistant to the president of the World Food Prize Foundation,
			the source of this number is Gregg Easterbrook's 1997 article "Forgotten
			Benefactor of Humanity." The article states that the "form of agriculture
			that Borlaug preaches may have prevented a billion deaths." He was
			awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 in recognition of his contributions
			to world peace through increasing food supply. Later in his life, he
			helped apply these methods of increasing food production in Asia and
			Africa.
