        Robotics is the branch of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering
        and computer science that deals with the design, construction,
        operation, and application of robots, as well as computer systems for,
        their coptrol and processing. These technologies deal with automated
        machines that can take’the place of a human in various kinds of work,
        activities, environments and processes. The definition of the word robot
        has a different meaning to many people. According to the Robot Institute
        of America, 1979, a robot is a re-programmable, multi-functional
        manipulator designed to move material, parts, tools, or specialised
        devices through various programmed motions for the performance of a
        variety of tasks. The use of robots continues to change numerous aspect
        of our everyday life, such as health care, education and job
        satisfaction. Robots are going to be a major part of the world economy,
        they help ways to make our daily life easier and assist in producing
        more products. Robotic technology is becoming one of the leading
        technologies in the world. They can perform many functions. They are
        used in many different ways in today’s society. The use of robotic
        technology has made an immediate impact on the world in several ways. As
        technological advances continue, research design and building new robots
        serve various practical purposes, whether domestic, commercial or
        military. Many robots even do the jobs that are hazardous to people such
        as defusing bombs, mining and exploring shipwrecks. There are numerous
        uses of robots which not only give better results but also help in
        saving money as well as time. <br><br>The robots can provide high quality
        components and finished products, and do so reliably and repeatedly even
        in hazardous or unpleasant environments. There are various industry
        segments which are making use of robotics to improve their production
        capabilities. Much of the research in robotics focuses not on specific
        industrial tasks, but on investigations into new types of robots,
        alternative ways to think about or design robots, and new ways to
        manufacture them. Recently, Apollo Hospital group installed the world’s
        most advanced CyberKnife robotic radio surgery system at the cancer
        speciality centre in Chennai, India. Although it meant substantial price
        for the hospital, Apollo decided to go ahead with the project due to the
        new-found enthusiasm for robotics in India. From the Chandrayaan I
        project for sending robots to moon, to biomedical engineering and the
        auto industry, India has been using robotics on a wide scale. In an
        increasingly technology-driven country, robotics has fast assumed
        significance not only for industrial applications, but also in various
        day-to-day human activities. Presently, robotics is the pinnacle of
        technical development. Though robotics in India is at a nascent stage,
        but industrial automation in India has opened up huge potential for
        robotics. Innovation coupled with consolidated research and development
        has catapulted India’s scientific position in robotic technology. The
        country is soon to become a major hub for the production of robots. The
        global market for robots is projected to rise by an average of about 4%,
        while in India, the industry is expected to grow at a rate 2.5 times
        that of the global average. <br><br>In medical field, the importance of robotics
        has been growing. Robotics is increasingly being used in a variety of
        clinical and surgical settings for increasing surgical accuracy and
        decreasing operating time and often to create better healthcare outcomes
        than standard current approaches. These medical robots are used to train
        surgeons, assist in difficult and precise surgical procedures, and to
        assist patients in recovery. The automobile industry is equally
        dominated by robots. There are multiple number of industrial robots
        functioning on fully automated production lines especially the high and
        efficient luxury and sports cars. The use of industrial robots has
        helped to increase productivity rate, efficiency and quality of
        distribution. Another major area where the use of robots is extensive is
        the packaging section. The packaging done using real robots is of very
        high quality as there is almost no chances of any human error. Another
        example where robotics is used is the electronic field. These are mainly
        in the mass-production with full accuracy and reliability. With these
        varied usages of robots Bill Gates has said “Robots will be the Next
        World-Changing Technology” Robotic has spread like an infection to an
        extent that so many movies and serials are also based on its theme. Some
        popular movies include Star Wars, Robocop, Ra one, Transformers etc.
        With such acclaimed popularity India too has come up with the Robotics
        Society of India (RSI). It is an academic society founded on 10th July,
        2011, which aims at promoting Indian robotics and automation activities.
        The society hopes to serve as a bridge between researchers in
        institutes, government research centres and industry.
