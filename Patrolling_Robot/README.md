# ABOUT PROJECT

To aid human lives and perform tasks in efficient manner in pandemic environment new robotic technologies and new implementations using those are highly encouraged. To help with task like patrolling, monitoring and security this robotic solution is proposed. This Autonomous Patrolling Robot system performs task like patrolling, monitoring and enforcing the security of the environment. According to all the functionalities it has shown the project prototype is called (Autonomous) Patrolling Robot.<br>

Currently world is facing COVID 19 Pandemic to aid humankind many technologies are used to ensure safety. Proposed Robot has an Autonomous System and Human Detection based Crowd Alert System. It represents an approach to improving the autonomous vehicle system, which will provide on demand services like transport and food delivery, etc. The patrolling robot will have ability to detect obstacles in its way as its first objective and find path which will be obstacle free path. Development of a custom trained autonomous robot which is capable to optimising its own route through the input given by user.<br>

The other goal of the project is to build the Human Detection and Counting System through Webcam, Videos or Images. The system will be used in Patrolling Robot to detect and count pedestrians with through Pi Camera. The system uses computer vision and image processing methods to implement the project. By considering the count of people it will alert whether the place is crowded or not. Hence the Robot will possess an Autonomous path planning and Human Detection Algorithm.
